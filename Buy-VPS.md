# Where to buy VPS

The first thing that is needed to participate in Node Testnets is a VPS server

In order to buy a VPS ( Cloud Server), I introduce several good (in my opinion) foreign & Iranian providers with and without crypto payment with brief information

| Provider |   Payment   | Discription                     |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Hetznr      | `Credit card - need KYC` | `Best Hosting , expensive , auction servers are good` |
| Contabo      | `Credit card - need KYC` | `Cheap but for a very few nodes we had bandwidth issues` |
| [Hostbrr](https://hostbrr.com/)      | `Crypto` | `Cheap to Normal pricing` |
| [Bartarvs](https://bartarvs.net/)      | `Rial - Crypto` | `Iranian - Myloc & Contabo cloud servers are cheap and best` |
| [Aeza](https://aeza.net/)     | `Crypto` | `Best for hourly servers` |
