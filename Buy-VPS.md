# 1- Where to buy VPS

The first thing that is needed to participate in Node Testnets is a VPS server

In order to buy a VPS ( Cloud Server), I introduce several good (in my opinion) foreign & Iranian providers with and without crypto payment with brief information

| Provider |   Payment   | Discription                     |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Hetznr      | `Credit card - need KYC` | `Best Hosting , expensive , auction servers are good` |
| Contabo      | `Credit card - need KYC` | `Cheap but for a very few nodes we had bandwidth issues` |
| [Hostbrr](https://hostbrr.com/)      | `Crypto` | `Cheap to Normal pricing` |
| [Bartarvs](https://bartarvs.net/)      | `Rial - Crypto` | `Iranian - Myloc & Contabo cloud servers are cheap and best` |
| [Aeza](https://aeza.net/)     | `Crypto` | `Best for hourly servers` |

### I'm not REPONSIBLE nor AFFILATED with any of these providers. I just used them before, and I think they are good choice. You can choose wherever you think is better

# 2- What system to buy
Before buying a VPS, we must consider several components to choose the required system

* `CPU`: Usually, 4core to 16core
* `Ram`: Usually, 4GB to 32GB
* `HDD`, `SSD`: Projects always consider the hard disk of the Nodes to be higher than required. In few nodes such as `Prover` or `Validator in Active-set` maybe a lot of hard disk is needed. Minimum is better to be `60` 
* `Operating-system` must be `Ubuntu`, `Ubuntu 22` is usually compatible with every project
* VPS must be ipv4 and must NOT be NAT

# 3- Let's Buy a VPS
To understand better, let's buy a server from 2 Iranian and foreign providers

This is not an advice to buy from them and I just want to show you the process

### After this guide, I'm not sure if they will get out of stock of their servers, you can consider creating a ticket to ask before proceeding to buy

## Hostbrr
Let's list some of their servers orders:

> High RAM: [Memory-Optimized VPS](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/main/packages/largeram/?group_id=23)
> 
> High RAM - Better net bandwidth: [RAM-Optimized - Premium](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/main/packages/largeram/?group_id=38)
> 
> Good CPU: [AMD Ryzen 9 7950XD](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/main/packages/vps7950/?group_id=14)
> 
> Good CPU - Cheaper: [AMD Ryzen 9 5950X](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/main/packages/vpsgermany/?group_id=13)
> 
> High SSD - Out of stock right now: [Big Storage Servers](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/main/index/storage) 

### I pick $14.99 VPS from [AMD Ryzen 9 5950X](https://my.hostbrr.com/order/main/packages/vpsgermany/?group_id=13)

* 4 vCore ,8GB RAM, 150 GB Storage can be a good choice for me
